It was framed as a hoax to &quot;own&quot; Leftists through trickery and <a href=\"#gaslighting\">gaslighting</a>.</p>\n<p>The hand gesture has been used by White Supremacists as a dogwhistle to identify other White Supremacists <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/milo-yiannopoulos-banned-from-furry-convention/\">at rallies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/09/18/ok-sign-white-power-symbol-or-just-right-wing-troll\">in forums</a>, and even <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/03/15/suspected-new-zealand-shooter-appears-in-court/\">at court hearings</a>. In 2019, the hand gesture was added to the <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/ok-and-other-alt-right-memes-and-slogans-added-to-adls-hate-symbols-database\">Anti-Defamation League's list of official symbols of hate</a>.</p>\n<h4>Issues</h4>\n<p>While it can be argued that the symbol's origins and many of its uses do not imply racist connotations, and that the 4chan-ers &quot;framed it as a hoax,&quot; it is undeniable that the symbol has evolved and become a gesture used sincerely by white supremacists.</p>\n<p>The uncertainty created by the 4chan-ers is a critical part of their strategy. The strategy employs plausible deniability: Because they self-identified it as a hoax, they can fall back on that explanation. Meanwhile, if people begin to adapt the symbol, as they did, it becomes a dogwhistle for White Supremacists. It should be noted that this approach of indoctrinating symbols of hate is one long-documented, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-nazis-twisted-the-swastika-into-a-symbol-of-hate-83020\">used for the Swastika as well</a>.</p>\n<h4>Impact</h4>\n<p>The people most vulnerable to the oppressive impact of White Supremacy will never know for certain if the symbol is being used in one of its non-violent manners or if it's being used in its racist violent manners. The oppressed must choose the option that protects them, which is typically erring on the side of caution.</p>\n<p>Continuing to use the symbol with its non-hateful connotations to &quot;take it back,&quot; does not eliminate its pervasive new meaning associated with White Supremacy. Instead, continuing usage only perpetuates emotional and psychological harm upon the most vulnerable and susceptible populations.</p>\n"
